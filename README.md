The project created by Nate, Armaan, Pradeep, and Pavi for BoilerMake V

Police Data Clarity is a development of the clarity API for the Chicago Police Department that aims to help police officers understand their impact
on their city, and to provide a source of motivation to improve as a police officer. By showing them their performance in each of several categories,
officers can see what their weak point is, and eventually improve on it. By comparing officers to others in their area, they are encouraged to
perform their best.
